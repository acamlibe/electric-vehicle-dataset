Electric vehicles can be split up into two broad categories:

EV ownership has increased over the years as citizens of Washington are reluctant to pay for high gas prices. Washington state ranks 4th in the nation for highest gas prices.

Along with high gas prices, the State of Washington passed, in 2019, a bill to determine eligibility for the **Clean Alternative Fuel Eligibility (CAFV)** status. This bill protects consumers and provides benefits for EV vehicles that are eligible.
